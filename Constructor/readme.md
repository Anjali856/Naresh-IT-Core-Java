# ðŸ’¼ Employee Salary Calculator (Java Constructor Example)

This project demonstrates the use of **Constructors**, **Encapsulation**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java.  
It takes user input (via the console) for employee details, calculates the updated salary based on the number of projects completed, and displays the results.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The project contains two main classes:

1. **`EmployeeTester` (ELC - Execution Logic Class)**  
   - Takes input from the user using the `Scanner` class.  
   - Creates an `Employee` object using a parameterized constructor.  
   - Calls the `calculateSalary()` method to compute the updated salary.  
   - Prints employee details.

2. **`Employee` (BLC - Business Logic Class)**  
   - Holds employee details such as first name, last name, ID, salary, and project count.  
   - Contains business logic to calculate salary based on project numbers.  
   - Demonstrates constructor usage and method overriding with `toString()`.
