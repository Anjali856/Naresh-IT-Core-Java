# 💼 Employee Efficiency Program

## 📘 Overview
This Java project demonstrates **Encapsulation** and **Copy Constructor** concepts using an **Employee Work Pattern Analysis**.  
The program determines whether an employee is **Efficient** or **Not Efficient** based on the number of days worked in a month.  

If the number of days worked is a **prime number**, the employee is considered **Efficient**, otherwise **Not Efficient**.

---

## 🧩 Key OOP Concepts
- **Encapsulation** → Private fields with public getters and setters  
- **Copy Constructor** → Used to duplicate employee object data  
- **Prime Number Logic** → Determines efficiency
